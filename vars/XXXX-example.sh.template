# emacs ==> -*- mode: sh; eval: (auto-complete-mode 1); -*-

# * This uses a very simple one-line-per-var format with no trailing comments
#   or spaces, for easy grepping and sanitising in shellscript. The assignment
#   is done with "eval", so be sure to escape/quote whatever needs to not be
#   expanded. Empty and commented lines are ignored.
#
#   Limitation: Pseudo-hash records can't include vertical or horizontal
#   whitespace (tabs, spaces, newlines, etc), and all but the last pseudo-hash
#   field in each record can't include the field-delimiter ":". For anything
#   too complex for such limitations it is better to copy the content as new
#   files from the "content" dir, or include the content in patches in the
#   "patches" dir.

#### GENERAL ####

# Dump lots of info to stderr for this deploy (set $debug_global in external_vars.sh
# to force debug everywhere).
debug='0'

#### DEPLOY ####

# NB:
#  * Keep commands below idempotent (with checks for existence, etc) - they will be
#    eval-ed on every deploy, therefore on every git-push...
#  * In the pseudo-hashes the target-dir is listed without the runtime-timestamp
#    (which gets appended).
