# emacs ==> -*- mode: sh; eval: (auto-complete-mode 1); -*-

# * This uses a very simple one-line-per-var format with no trailing comments
#   or spaces, for easy grepping and sanitising in shellscript. The assignment
#   is done with "eval", so be sure to escape/quote whatever needs to not be
#   expanded. Empty and commented lines are ignored. Limitation: values can't
#   include vertical or horizontal whitespace (tabs, spaces, newlines, etc).

# when this equals 1 it forces debugging everywhere despite the setting of $debug in the vars-files
debug_global=1

# this regex should be of the form 'a|b|c|d'
git_protected_branches_regex='master'

# $services_password, $repo, $branch, $bare_domain, $server_aliases, $main_alias, $ns_1, $public_ipv4_address will be auto-added by provision.sh
